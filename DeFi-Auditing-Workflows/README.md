#  DeFi Auditing Workflows

This folder contains the auditing workflows I personally follow when auditing complex DeFi protocols.

## Why this exists?

Over time, I’ve built a structured auditing strategy for each major DeFi vertical I specialize in:
- Lending Protocols
- Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes)
- NFT Marketplaces
- Staking Mechanisms

Each workflow reflects how I:
- Break down the architecture of a protocol,
- Categorize functions (user, risk, math, admin),
- Organize time across audit days (e.g., Day 1 to Day 10),
- Maintain a repeatable auditing process.

## What's here?

- Lending-Workflow.md → Structured approach for auditing lending protocols.
- DEX-Workflow.md → Workflow for analyzing AMMs, TWAMMs, and custom swaps.
- Staking-Workflow.md → Checks for reward logic, lockups, APYs, and more.
- NFT-Workflow.md → Focused review of ERC721, royalties, and marketplace flows.

> I'm still refining these workflows, and will share each file once it's complete.

Stay tuned!
